here is a sample how to **GetHighestSalaryAverageCititesNamesInteractor**
```
class GetHighestSalaryAverageCititesNamesInteractor(
    private val dataSource: CostOfLivingDataSource,
) {

    fun execute(limit: Int): List<String> {
        return dataSource
            .getAllCitiesData()
            .filter(::excludeNullSalariesAndLowQualityData)
            .sortedByDescending { it.averageMonthlyNetSalaryAfterTax }
            .take(limit)
            .map { it.cityName }
    }

    private fun excludeNullSalariesAndLowQualityData(city: CityEntity): Boolean {
        return city.averageMonthlyNetSalaryAfterTax != null && city.dataQuality
    }

}
```

> Be aware from requirements description if we said a function return cities name that mean it should return `List<String>` but if we said a function return cities that mean `List<CityEntity>`

> Note: the dataQulaity property which is boolean take 2 values if it is `true` that mean the data qulaity is high and if it is `false` thats mean the data quality for this city is low.

> Note: there is no data set in the world is totaly clean, be aware of missing field don't use them for calculations!
